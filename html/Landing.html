                    <p>Organic architecture is a design philosophy that seeks to create spaces in harmony with nature. Coined by Frank Lloyd Wright, 
                        it emphasizes the relationship between the structure and its environment, using natural materials and forms to create a seamless 
                        blend between the built and the natural world</p>

                    <p>In a world where sustainability is increasingly crucial, organic architecture offers a path to environmentally 
                        responsible design. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about creating buildings that coexist with their surroundings, 
                        reduce environmental impact, and promote a healthier lifestyle for their inhabitants</p>

                    <h2>Conservation Methods in Organic Architecture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Organic architecture emphasizes the use of natural materials and the integration of the building into the surrounding environment. 
                        It also promotes the use of construction techniques that minimize waste and energy consumption. 
                        One such technique is passive design, which focuses on maximizing natural light and ventilation to reduce the need for artificial 
                        lighting and air conditioning.
